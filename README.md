This is my GKZ Calculator!

To help figure everything out, I've included a brief "Documentation" section to outline the operations of the most important functions.
There are some scattered comments in the function definition section which might provide some insight but overall, it's kind of a mess - sorry about that.

I will update the project as I make progress and develop more features.
